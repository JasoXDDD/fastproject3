<h2 id="Challenge-2:-Turtle">Challenge 2: Turtle<a class="anchor-link" href="#Challenge-2:-Turtle"> </a></h2><p>Turtle is a python <strong> library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It's ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a </strong> __ to display what you've done, but unfortunately it's kind of annoying to make work with vscode.</p>
<p>Use: repl.it</p>
<p>Click "+ Create", and for language, select "Python (with Turtle)"</p>
<p>Documentation</p>
<p>Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn't mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it</p>
<p>Commands</p>
<p>forward(pixels)</p>
<p>right(degrees)</p>
<p>left(degrees)</p>
<p>setpos(x,y)</p>
<p>speed(speed)</p>
<p>pensize(size)</p>
<p>pencolor(color)</p>
<p>Note: Color should be within quotes, like "brown", or "red"</p>

<p>Challenge 3: Math
The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods!</p>
<p>methods Action
ceil(x) <strong></strong>  rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x
factorial(x)    <strong></strong>  returns the greatest common denominator of x and y
lcm(x,y)    __
Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>each number rounded up</li>
<li>each number rounded down</li>
<li>the lcm of the rounded down numbers</li>
<li>the gcf of the rounded up numbers</li>
<li>the factorial of each number</li>
<li>something else using the math package!</li>
